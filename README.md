### The project is divided into three main files:

`partition-data.ipynb`: Ideated and used to partition the reddit dataset into smaller chunks to be uploaded to our own HDFS cluster.

`preprocessing-and-analysis.ipynb`: Preprocessing and top-25 subreddits sentiment analysis of a reddit dataset chunk.

`scalability-tests.ipynb`: Performed tests to compare compute time with different ressource allocation and dataset size.
